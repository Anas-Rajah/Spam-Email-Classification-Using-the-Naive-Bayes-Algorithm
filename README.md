# Spam-Email-Classification-Using-the-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm

# Project Overview:

This project involves the classification of spam emails using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular supervised machine learning technique. The algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem and is used to estimate the probability that an email is spam based on its features. In this project, a simple Python program was developed to classify emails as spam or not spam. The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that the presence of each word in an email is independent of the others, making it highly efficient for text classification tasks. The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of Naive Bayes in filtering spam emails, providing a reliable solution to the growing issue of unwanted emails.
